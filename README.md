# MarkDown Toys

[[Demo](https://yieldray.github.io/markdown-toys/)]

This project is a demo of the [Soda](https://github.com/YieldRay/soda) React component library.

Thanks to the following libraries for making this project possible:

-   [`unified`](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified): Powers the conversion between Markdown and HTML.
-   [`@mozilla/readability`](https://github.com/mozilla/readability): Powers the readability function, making text content easier to read.

Of course, this project also relies on other libraries, which are listed in the package.json file.
