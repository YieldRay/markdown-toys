/**
 * [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/open)
 * @param url
 * A string indicating the URL or path of the resource to be loaded. If an empty string (`""`) is specified or this parameter is omitted, a blank page is opened into the targeted browsing context.
 * @param target
 * A string, without whitespace, specifying the [name](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/name) of the browsing context the resource is being loaded into. If the name doesn't identify an existing context, a new context is created and given the specified name. The special [`target` keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target), `_self`, `_blank`, `_parent`, and `_top`, can also be used.
 *
 * This `name` can be used as the target attribute of [<a>](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target) or [<form>](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#target) elements.
 * @param features
 * A string containing a comma-separated list of window features in the form `name=value` â€” or for boolean features, just name. These features include options such as the window's default size and position, whether or not to open a minimal popup window, and so forth.
 * @returns [WindowProxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/WindowProxy)
